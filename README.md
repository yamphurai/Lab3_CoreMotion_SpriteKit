# Lab3_CoreMotion_SpriteKit

Module A
Create an iOS application that:

Displays the number of steps a user has walked today and display the number of steps a user walked yesterday
Displays a realtime count of the number of steps a users has taken today (this could be the same label as "number of steps today")
Displays the number of steps until the user reaches a (user settable) daily goal (the goal should be saved persistently so that it is remembered even when the app restarts) 
Displays the current activity of the user: {unknown, still, walking, running, cycling, driving}
Use a highly visual Interface for displaying the information
Module B
Create an additional part of the app that, whenever the user meets their step goal for the previous day, allows the playing of a simple game. The game must: 

Use {acceleration, gyro, magnetometer, AND/OR fused motion} to control some part of the physics of a SpriteKit (or SceneKit) game
Use two or more SpriteKit (or SceneKit) Nodes with dynamic physics
Incorporate Collision detection through delegation
Exceptional Work 5000 students: you have free rein to add something to your app. For example, using SceneKit counts towards exceptional credit. 
Exceptional Work 7000 students: use the steps of a user as some type of "currency" in the game to incentivize movement during the day
The application should make use of the A-series motion controls whenever possible. Verify the functionality of the application to the instructor during lab time or office hours (or scheduled via email).
